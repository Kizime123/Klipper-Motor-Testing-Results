# Klipper-Motor-Testing-Results
Currently I have these motors for testing:

LDO [48-2804AH](https://northprint3d.ca/product/ldo-42sth48-2804-2-8a-super-power-stepper-motor/)

LDO [48-2504AH](https://www.3dlabtech.ca/product/ldo-nema17-motor-ldo-42sth48-2504ah/)

LDO [48-2004MAH](https://www.3dlabtech.ca/product/ldo-nema17-motor-ldo-42sth48-2004mah/)

LDO [60-3004AC](https://peedee3d.com/collections/motion/products/kraken-by-omranello-1-8-ldo-42sth60-3004acs40_)

OMC [17HE19-2004S](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/e-series-nema-17-bipolar-55ncm-77-88oz-in-2a-42x48mm-4-wires-w-1m-cable-connector-17he19-2004s)

LEADSHINE [42CM06](https://www.leadshine.com/product-detail/42CM06.html)

Wantai [42BYGHM810](https://archive.fabacademy.org/2017/fablabverket/students/100/web/assignments/week11/3302_0_Datasheet.pdf)

Moons [MS17HD6P420I-04](https://www.moonsindustries.com/p/nema-17-standard-hybrid-stepper-motors/ms17hd6p4200-m-000004611110026893)

Testing methodology:

I'll be running: https://github.com/MRX8024/chopper-resonance-tuner/blob/main/wiki/chopper_tuning_guide_english.md 

at 24v on tmc2209s.

Then 24v on tmc5160s.

Then 48v on tmc5160s.


Then testing for max speeds I can get out of them.

Then I'll run a VFA test at various speeds including motor resonance bands.


[Updates]
The leadshines are currently being run on the cycle!
